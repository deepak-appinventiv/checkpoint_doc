# Custom Weather Card

The `WeatherCard` component is a beautifully designed UI element used to display weather information dynamically. This component is optimized for our app, ensuring seamless integration and accurate representation of weather data.

## Props

| Prop              | Type          | Default | Description                                                                    |

| `backgroundImage` | `ImageSource` | `null`  | The background image for the weather card, enhancing visual appeal.            |

## Data Extraction

The `WeatherCard` fetches and displays the following details from `weatherData`:

- **Temperature**: Average temperature for the day.
- **Precipitation Probability**: Maximum precipitation probability.
- **Weather Code**: Used to determine the weather condition and fetch appropriate icons.
- **Sunrise and Sunset**: Determines whether the current time is daytime or nighttime.

## Methods and Utilities

The component utilizes several utility functions for enhanced functionality:

- **`isDaytime(sunrise, sunset)`**: Determines whether it is currently daytime based on sunrise and sunset times.
- **`fetchWeatherCodeIcon(weatherCode)`**: Fetches the appropriate weather icon based on the weather code.
- **`getWeatherCodeDescription(weatherCode)`**: Provides a descriptive label for the weather condition.
